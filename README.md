## How to configure the plugin?

This plugin makes use of a json configuration file (`ec2-connect-config.json`) where you can specify the parameters needed to establish the tunnel.

You can use the below example to create your own file and place it in the Leapp installation folder (usually in `$HOME` (macos/linux/powershell) or `%USERPROFILE%` (windows/CMD) user directory).

For example:

`$HOME/.Leapp/ec2-connect-config.json`

You can find an example of such file in this repository called `ec2-connect-config.example.json`

```json
